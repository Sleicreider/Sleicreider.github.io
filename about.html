				<h1>Dominik "Sleicreider" Reisner</h1>

				<br>
				<br> I'm Dominik, a 23 years old video game developer and c++ enthusiast from Austria , currently living in UK - Wilmslow. 
                <br> I'm working as Junior Tools Programmer for Traveller's Tales ( TT Games ) in the UK.
				
		        <br> I'm professionally working in the games industry for 3-4 years now now and a little more in overall software development with C/C++.
                <br> My interests and hobbies are playing video games, games development, low latency high performance programming and also motocross.
				<br> Beside programming I'm also a passionate gamer and at the moment my favorite game is WoW and Dota2.
                <br> But the best game for me will always be Guild Wars(1).
				<br>
				<br> Privately I'm more working on gameplay/mechanics Programming stuff or general c++ stuff, where I'm constantly
				<br> trying to expand my knowledge in this area and also general software development.
				<br> For dedicated work I'm more interested in low level high performance c++ programming, therefore I'm
				<br> really interested in game engine / systems programming where this level of performance is necessary and
				<br> knowledge is necessary.
                <br>
