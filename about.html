				<h1>Dominik "Sleicreider" Reisner</h1>

				<br>
				<br> I'm Dominik, a 24 years old video game developer and c++ enthusiast from Austria , currently living in UK - Wilmslow. 
                <br> Currently working full time as non gamedev / normal software developer where we focus on desktop sharing technologies.
				<br> Recently I've relocated back from UK to austria mainly to start my own gamedev company beside my full time job.
				
		        <br> I'm professionally working in the games industry for nearly 4 years now and a little more in overall software development with C/C++.
                <br> My interests and hobbies are playing video games, games development, low latency high performance programming and also motocross/motocycles.
				<br> Beside programming I'm also a passionate gamer and at the moment my favorite game is WoW and Dota2.
                <br> But the best game for me will always be Guild Wars(1).
				<br>
				<br> Privately I'm more working on gameplay/mechanics Programming stuff or general c++ stuff, where I'm constantly
				<br> trying to expand my knowledge in this area and also general software development.
				<br> For dedicated work I'm more interested in low level high performance c++ programming, therefore I'm
				<br> really interested in game engine / systems programming where this level of performance is necessary and
				<br> knowledge is necessary.
