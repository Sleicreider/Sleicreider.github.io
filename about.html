				<br>I'm Dominik from Austria. I'm 20 years old and went to a Higher Technical Institute in Austria(Styria) where I've gained all my software development knowledge.
				<br>2 years ago I've started with Game Development using Java / C++ & OpenGL for Android phones and PC(linux & windows). My final end project in school was to create a little Game Engine with Java + OpenGL ES for android.
				<br>Until now I worked 1 month as C# Software Developer (summer job) and as current occupation I'm working as C/C++ software developer (intralogistics , Linux & Oracle DB).
				<br>2 Weeks ago I bought the unreal engine 4, and I'm quite happy to have it, because it made my life much easier.
				<br>
				<br>Beside programming I'm also a passionate gamer and atm my favourite game is Dota 2.
