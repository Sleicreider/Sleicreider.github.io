				<br>I'm Dominik, a Game Developer from Austria. I'm 21 years old and went to a Higher Technical Institute in Austria(Styria) where I started to gain more knowledge about software development.
				<br>3 1/2 years ago I've started with Game Development using Java / C++ & OpenGL for Android phones and PC(linux & windows). My final end project in school was to create a little part of an 2D Game Engine with Java + OpenGL ES for android.
				<br>Until now I worked 1 month as C# Software Developer (summer job), 7 months as C/C++ software developer (intralogistics , Linux & Oracle DB), and as current occupation(since 09/2014) I'm working as C++ Mobile Games Developer at CervoMedia in Austria,Graz.
				<br>At CervoMedia we are developing our 2 top Android & iOS Games <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cervomedia.spw">Slots - Pharaoh's Way</a> and 
                <br><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cervomedia.spf&hl=de">Slots - Pharaoh's Fire</a>.
				<br>Beside my occupation i'm working on my own Game projects: <a href="https://github.com/Sleicreider/hazelnut2k15">Hazelnut</a> which is a 2D Android & iOS game based on the idea of an old PC game where we are using the cocos2d-x Engine, 
                <br>C++ and an custom cocos2d-x Framework devopled by myself. Unreal Engine 4 Tutorial Box: This project is just for learning purpose, which includes several 3D RPG/MMO elements like Movement-,Damage-,Skill-,Inventory System. Developed in C++.
				<br>Beside programming I'm also a passionate gamer and at the moment my favourite game is Dota 2.
                <br>But the best game for me will always be Guild Wars(1).
