            <b>22/01/2018</b> GameTool - Open Source Project

             I had this idea for a long time, and just started this non coding intensive project,
             because it's kinda usefull for myself.
             <br><br>Since I came here to UK, i kinda realized that my PC isn't the best anymore, 
             and it often was running on it's MAX and needed to check 
             running Applications when playing games or compiling,
             otherwise I'd have a worse experience when working with the PC.
             Task Manager helps but it has too much unecessary info and it's not handy when playing games. Therefore I've started this Tool project
             which will stick in front of all applications, small(like NVIDIAS show FPS), customizable(in the future). At the momen CPU and RAM works perfectly
             and it's running in the background all the time.

            <b>14/11/2017</b> First time part of an AAA game - Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2!
		</header>
        
        <article class="tab">
            <br> I'm working professionally in the games industry for little more than 3 years now but
			<br> today my first AAA game got release where I was working as part of the Tools Programming Team.
			<br> I have to admit, I love the Marvel story and watched all Marvel movies multiple times, therefore 
			<br> it is amazing to be a part of a marvel game :)
			<br> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ud1g5JdGdM"> Youtube Link </a> Check out the amazing Thor Ragnarok inspired trailer, it's awesome!

            <br> I've left Cervo Media and moved to UK - Wilmslow to work for Traveller's Tales (TT Games) as Junior Tools Programmer.
			<br> This is my first time relocating and first time working for an AAA games company.
			<br> Unfortunately I had to stop working on commercial side projects, but I'll start other private project for learning purpose.
