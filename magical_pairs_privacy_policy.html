WHICH DATA WE COLLECT AND PROCESS\n
\n
In General:\n
"Magical Pairs" processes personal data that you as a user of the Products make available to us,\n
for example by sending emails to our support through the in-game support feature. At the current state of the game,\n
we don’t directly collect any data of the user, except when he is contacting our support. However this might change in the future, \n
to povide a better gaming experience.\n
\n
UPDATE:\n
Altough, we don't directly process user data, we use third party tools like Firebase (owned by Google LLC) which can collect user data.\n
Firebase is used by our team to identify issues with the game, and process player feedback, but only to provide\n
better player experience.\n
\n
Data You Provide to Us:\n
Currently you can only provide us with data by contacting the support via E-Mail,\n
either directly or through the game mailing feature. \n
\n
In - Game emailing support:\n
Mandatory Information: You have to provide us with certain information in order to contact our support:\n
 - Email address\n
 - Device Information (including hardware address for Android users, Model, Build, etc.)\n
   Only used to identify the user and be able to support him in-game(restore partial data,\n
   solve issues specific to your device, fixing potential software issues)\n

\n				
Data Google Firebase is collecting:\n
<a href="https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039?hl=en">https://support.google.com/firebase/answer/6318039?hl=en</a>\n
   \n

WHY WE PROCESS DATA (“PURPOSES”)\n
\n
Operating the Products:\n
We process your Data to be able to provide you with a seamless user experience when using the Products.\n
\n
Providing Services:\n
If in any case, you have any issues with the device or the game itself, the support is able to help you \n
and partly restore aspects of the game, in order to do so, we have to know some of your device information to be able\n
to identify you as user. However data is only stored for a short amount of time and will never be collected \n
for any other use than to supporting our players.\n
\n
HOW LONG WE STORE DATA\n
\n
Storage Period:\n
Since we only support data to be able to support you in-game, we only store the data \n
for the duration of the support session and until you’ve collected every support data sent to you.\n
Firebase themself might store information for longer\n
